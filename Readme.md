Shape Cutters
=============

These SCAD files describe shapes for various cutters for cookies and fondant.

This project is an experiment to help my wife with decorating cakes.

The *cutters.scad* file attempts to lay out multiple cutters and sizes in a
printable grid.

Safety note
-----------

3D printed plastics may only be safe for single use. And do you know what is in
that dye they use to color the PLA?  If you can print with plain PLA that would
probably be better.
